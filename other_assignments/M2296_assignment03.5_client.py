Assignment:
    Write a client and a server program that can be used to send files 
    to the server. You have to come up with a simple protocol 
    (you donâ€™t have to document the protocol, but you can) 
    which allows the transfer of files. The protocol should be able to 
    transmit name, size and contents of the file being sent. 
    It is up to you to implement this. The client HAS to send this 
    information:

    name of the file
    size of the file (in bytes!)
    contents of the file (actual bytes of the file from disk)

    When the server receives the connection, it uses this information 
    to:

    create a new file with the same name
    receive the total size of the file to receive (in bytes)
    Receive the contents of the file and write them to a file on disk.
        under the received files directory.
        name of the file has to be same as the one that the client sent

Start early so you can ask questions from the lecturer!

Client

The client takes three command line parameters:

    path of the file to send
    server address
    server port

The client will print an error message and exits if any of the following 
conditions are met:

    The file is missing
    The file cannot be read from
    The client cannot connect to the server
    any others that you can think of
